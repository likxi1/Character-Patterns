# Character-Patterns

Using two characters: . (dot) and * (asterisk) print a grid-like pattern.

## Input

You are given t - the number of test cases and for each of the test cases two positive integers: l - the number of lines and c - the number of columns in the grid. Each square of the grid is of the same size and filled with 4 dots (see the example below).

## Output

For each of the test cases output the requested pattern (please have a look at the example). Use one line break in between successive patterns.

## Example

### Input:
```bash
3
3 1
4 4
